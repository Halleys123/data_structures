# Recursion

- When a function calls itself until a specific condition is met, it is called a recursive function.
- The process of a function calling itself is called recursion.

## Infinite Recursion

`specific condition` mentioned above is very important. If the condition is not met, the function will keep calling itself infinitely. This is called infinite recursion.

- Infinite recursion can cause the stack to overflow.
- It is important to have a base case to stop the recursion.
